SPPurchaseButton imitates the purchase button found in App Store, but with an added feedback mode.

It works with (and requires) autolayout, and animates using layout constraints.

The button has a confirmation state and a feedback state, and can be set up to use either one or both.

## Installation

SPPurchaseButton is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
